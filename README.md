# BankDataset

Tasks
Import the libraries and load the dataset (from the csv file) [3 points]

Pre-process the dataset and provide a detailed explanation. [10 points]

Perform 2 visualizations of the features with respect to target variable with detailed explanation. [10 points]

Determine Six most influential attributes on target attribute (with explanation). You do not necessarily need to drop the remaining features for the Decision Tree Classifier. Your task is just to determine and show the Six most influential attributes with detailed explanation. [5 points]

Split your dataset 75% for training, and 25% for testing the classifier. [2 points]

Use gini and entropy (play around with max_depth and min_samples_leaf parameters) to measure the quality of a split. [5 points]

Use comments to explain your code and variable names. [4points]

Calculate and print the confusion matrix (use graphics instead showing a 2D array), and the classification Report (includes: precision, recall, f1-score, and support) for both criteria. [10 points]

Compare the results of the classifier using gini and entropy [6 points]

Print the decision tree visualization with depth of 5 [6points]

Perform the Random Forest Classifier(RFC) with the same dataset [6]

Evaluate the decision tree model and Random Forest Classifier[6]

Perform and plot the ROC curves for the two classifiers on the same graph[6]

interpret the ROC graph[6]`
